## Olist Sales Analysis 
 This is a Sales Pattern Analysis for Olist Marketplace using Python.

## Objective 
Olist is a Brazilian online marketplace that operates through a website. Olist already has very good sales, but they want to uncover more information about their sales patterns. My task was to build an interactive dashboard that will visually showcase well-curated results of an advanced exploratory analysis conducted in Python. 

## Context
For this Achievement, I selected my own data to analyze, with the goal of conducting an exploratory visual analysis in Python and finding connections between variables that seem worth exploring. After developing hypotheses, I used various advanced analytical approaches to help me test my hypotheses. The results of my analyses is presented in a Tableau storyboard. Data dashboards are an effective tool for, among other purposes, presenting data in an accessible and tangible way. My dashboard tells the story of my analytical journey and, as such, contains a curation of the key results I discovered.

## Data 
The dataset comprises of information on the following parameters: 

- order reviews 
- orders
- order items
- sellers
- geolocation
- order-customer
- order payments
- products
